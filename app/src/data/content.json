It helps users keep track of, rate, comment on, and archive the games they've played.\nThe application is built with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend, using a MySQL database to store user data and game activity. User authentication is handled securely through Spring Security, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage their gaming history. Together, these technologies provide a seamless and secure experience for organizing your personal game archive.\n\nIn addition to developing the application, I also created both the UI design and the system design, giving me hands-on experience in planning and structuring a complete application from both a visual and architectural perspective.\n\nThe project is currently being deployed, with new features and improvements continuously being added.",
